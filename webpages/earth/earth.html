<h1> ---OUR EARTH--- </h1>
<p> <font face=calibri size=4 color=#232A61> Earth, also called the world and, less frequently, Gaia (and Terra in some works of science fiction) 
is the third planet from the Sun, the densest planet in the Solar System, the largest of the Solar System's four 
terrestrial planets, and the only astronomical object known to accommodate life. The earliest life on Earth arose 
at least 3.5 billion years ago. Earth's biodiversity has expanded continually except when interrupted 
by mass extinctions. Although scholars estimate that over 99 percent of all species that ever lived on the planet 
are extinct, Earth is currently home to 10–14 million species of life,including over 7.3 billion 
humans who depend upon its biosphere and minerals. Earth's human population is divided among about two hundred 
sovereign states which interact through diplomacy, conflict, travel, trade and communication media.</p>

According to evidence from radiometric dating and other sources, Earth was formed around four and a half billion 
years ago. Within its first billion years, life appeared in its oceans and began to affect its atmosphere and 
surface, promoting the proliferation of aerobic as well as anaerobic organisms and causing the formation of the 
atmosphere's ozone layer. This layer and the geomagnetic field blocked the most life-threatening parts of the Sun's 
radiation, so life was able to flourish on land as well as in water. Since then, the combination of Earth's 
distance from the Sun, its physical properties and its geological history have allowed life to thrive and evolve.</p>
<p>
Earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many 
millions of years. Seventy-one percent of Earth's surface is covered with water, with the remainder consisting of 
continents and islands that together have many lakes and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. 
Earth's poles are mostly covered with ice that includes the solid ice of the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of 
the polar ice packs. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates 
the magnetic field, and a thick layer of relatively solid mantle.</p>

Earth gravitationally interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon. During one orbit around 
the Sun, Earth rotates about its own axis 366.26 times, creating 365.26 solar days or one sidereal year. Earth's 
axis of rotation is tilted 23.4° away from the perpendicular of its orbital plane, producing seasonal variations on the 
planet's surface with a period of one tropical year (365.24 solar days). The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. 
It began orbiting Earth about 4.53 billion years ago. The Moon's gravitational interaction with Earth stimulates ocean 
tides, stabilizes the axial tilt and gradually slows the planet's rotation.</p>

<h2> Name & Etymology </h2></u>
<p><font face=calibri size=4> The modern English word Earth developed from a wide variety of Middle English forms, which derived from 
an Old English noun most often spelled eorðe. It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their proto-Germanic 
root has been reconstructed as *erþō. In its earliest appearances, eorðe was already being used to translate the many 
senses of Latin terra and Greek γῆ (gē): the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the 
surface of the world (including the sea), and the globe itself. As with Terra and Gaia, Earth was a personified 
goddess in Germanic paganism: the Angles were listed by Tacitus as among the devotees of Nerthus, and later Norse 
mythology included Jörð, a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.</p>

Originally, earth was written in lowercase and, from early Middle English, its definite sense as "the globe" was 
expressed as the earth. By early Modern English, many nouns were capitalized and the earth became (and often remained) 
the Earth, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply 
given as Earth, by analogy with the names of the other planets. House styles now vary: Oxford spelling recognizes 
the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes 
Earth when appearing as a name (e.g. "Earth's atmosphere") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by the (e.g. "the 
atmosphere of the earth"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as "what on earth are you doing?"</p>
