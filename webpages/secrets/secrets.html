<h2>Has the Missing 80% of the Universe’s Mass Been Found?</h2></font>
<p> <font face="Tw Cen MT" size=4 color=white>The universe has never made things easy: every time you look away, it becomes bigger, 
stranger, curiouser. And that’s only the part we can see. As you might have heard if you pay 
attention to these things (and will be distressed to learn if you don’t), up to 80% of the 
matter in the universe is simply missing. The Milky Way spins so fast it would fly apart if 
the gravity of some invisible matter weren’t holding it together. Clusters of galaxies, 
buzzing around one another like angry bees, would similarly fragment and disperse. And 
when you run the gravitational numbers, the mysterious matter that keeps all that cosmic 
disintegration from happening should outweigh the familiar stuff by about 4 to 1.</p>

<p> It was in the 1930s that astronomer Fritz Zwicky first proclaimed — to general skepticism — 
that what is now known commonly as dark matter must exist, surrounding most galaxies like a glass 
paperweight surrounds a butterfly. But not only could physicists not detect the material, they 
couldn’t even agree on what they should be looking for. Dark matter thus became as much an article 
of cosmological faith as of well-established theory. Now it appears that faith may have been rewarded. 
Just as researchers working at Europe’s Large Hadron Collider last year announced that they had bagged
 the Higgs Boson, so did investigators this week reveal that they’ve found compelling evidence for a 
type of theorized particle known as a WIMP — for weakly interacting massive particle — and that at least 
one form of it may be the dark quarry they’ve been hunting for 80 years.</p>
<p> The new findings come from a team of physicists led by Samuel Ting, of the European Organization for Nuclear 
Research, relying on data gathered by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), a detector delivered to the 
International Space Station in 2011. The purpose of the AMS is to sift incoming cosmic rays — streams of 
high energy pouring in from outside the solar system — for unusual particles. Dark-matter particles, if 
they exist, might also get mingled into this cosmic flow, but theories suggest they’d be hard to spot. 
They can pass through ordinary matter as if it weren’t there (billions could be streaming through your 
body as you read these words) and they’d be utterly invisible to any sort of telescope.</p>
<p>If we can’t detect dark matter itself, however, we might detect its byproducts. Theorists think that when 
two dark-matter particles meet out in space, they’ll occasionally, albeit not often, destroy each other in a 
tiny burst of energy. That energy would then condense back into entirely different particles: an ordinary electron 
and its much rarer antimatter counterpart, a positron, which would go speeding away from each other in some random direction.

It’s these positrons that AMS detected — some 400,000 of them in the nearly two years it’s been in operation.
 The number and energy of the positrons is consistent with what theorists would expect if dark matter really 
is smashing into itself throughout the Milky Way. So is the fact that the positrons are hitting the detector
 from all directions, which it should if dark matter truly pervades the Milky Way. Says Jeremiah Ostriker, 
a Princeton astrophysicist who has been in the forefront of dark-matter theory since the 1970s, “The AMS experiment 
may — just may — have detected [evidence of] dark-matter decay.”</p></font>
<font face=narkisim color=white><h2> The man who tapped the secrets of the Universe </h2></font>
<p> <font face="Tw Cen MT" size=4 color=white>This story of the life of Walter Russell was first published in 1946 when he lived in Carnegie Hall, in New York City. 
Many readers who are not now able to find him there are wondering where he is and if his activities have ceased because of 
his 85 years. The fact is he is more active than ever and still looks to the years ahead as the most important years of his life.
<p><img src=25.jpg align=left>
In 1948, Walter Russell and his wife Lao Russell acquired a famous Italian Renaissance marble palace and sculpture 
gardens on a Virginia mountain top to devote the rest of their lives to the arts, to philosophy and science for the 
betterment of human relations and for the unfoldment of the inherent genius which lies within every man.  Here are 
published all his books and music and here is to be found the great collection of his masterpieces in all of the arts, 
which she has gathered together as a memorial to her husband and as an inspiration to others.
<p>
Here also are the noted works of her own in philosophy and science, together with the books and sculpture which 
they have created together during the past ten years. Thousands journey every year to this mountain-top shrine 
where guides conduct them through the rooms filled with the works of both Walter and Lao Russell. Behind this 
palace are the gardens, adorned with their sculpture — his four Freedoms and the towering statue of the Christ
 of the Blue Ridge which Lao Russell conceived and they collaborated to produce. Perhaps the crowning sculptural 
achievement of their lives will be The Sermon on the Mount, which they are working on together when their busy 
lives give them time for inspirational creation.
<p>
Walter and Lao Russell have written a one-year Home Study Course in Universal Law, Natural Science and Philosophy 
which has girdled the world and inspired many with new knowledge of man’s relation to man, to God, and to the universe. 
This Home Study Course was written as a means for spreading throughout the world their teachings of the Light within man.</p></font>
