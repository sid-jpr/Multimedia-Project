<p> The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. Its name "milky" is derived from its 
appearance as a dim glowing band arching across the night sky in which the naked eye cannot distinguish 
individual stars. The term "Milky Way" is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the 
Greek γαλαξίας κύκλος (galaxías kýklos, "milky circle"). From Earth, the Milky 
Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei 
first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Up until the 
early 1920s, most astronomers thought that all of the stars in the Universe were contained inside
 of the Milky Way. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber 
Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies—now known to be billions.</p>

The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy that has a diameter usually considered to be roughly 100,000–120,000 
light-years in diameter but may be 150,000–180,000 light-years. The Milky Way is estimated to contain 
100–400 billion stars, although this number may be as high as one trillion. There are probably at least 
100 billion planets in the Milky Way. The Solar System is located within the disk, about 27,000 light-years 
from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge of one of the spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust called the 
Orion Arm. The stars in the inner ≈10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. 
The very center is marked by an intense radio source, named Sagittarius A*, which is likely to be a supermassive black hole.</p>
<p>
Stars and gases at a wide range of distances from the Galactic Center orbit at approximately 220 kilometers per 
second. The constant rotation speed contradicts the laws of Keplerian dynamics and suggests that much of the mass 
of the Milky Way does not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation. This mass has been given the name "dark matter".
The rotational period is about 240 million years at the position of the Sun. The Milky Way as a whole is 
moving at a velocity of approximately 600 km per second with respect to extragalactic frames of reference. 
The oldest stars in the Milky Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself and thus must have formed shortly after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>
Surrounded by several smaller satellite galaxies, the Milky Way is part of the Local Group of galaxies, 
which forms a subcomponent of the Virgo Supercluster, which again forms a subcomponent of the Laniakea Supercluster.</p></font>

<h2> Appearance </h2></font>
<font face=cambria size=4 color=#411313>
<p>When observing the night sky, the term "Milky Way" is limited to the hazy band of white light some 30 degrees 
wide arcing across the sky. Although all of the individual stars that can be seen in the entire sky with the 
naked eye are part of the Milky Way, the light in this band originates from the accumulation of un-resolved 
stars and other material when viewed in the direction of the Galactic plane. Dark regions within the band, such as 
the Great Rift and the Coalsack, correspond to areas where light from distant stars is blocked by interstellar dust. 
The region where the Milky Way is self-obscuring is also known as the zone of avoidance.</p>
<p>
The Milky Way has a relatively low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such 
as light pollution or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square 
arcsecond in order for the Milky Way to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately 
+5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. This makes the Milky Way difficult to see from any brightly 
lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon.</p>

<h2> Size & Mass </h2></font>
<font face=cambria size=4 color=#411313>
<p> The Milky Way is the second-largest galaxy in the Local Group, with its stellar disk approximately 100,000 ly (30 kpc) 
in diameter, and, on average, approximately 1,000 ly (0.3 kpc) thick. As a guide to the relative physical scale of 
the Milky Way, if the Solar System out to Neptune were the size of a US quarter (25mm), the Milky Way would be approximately 
the size of the United States. A ring-like filament of stars wrapping around the Milky Way may actually belong to the 
Milky Way itself, rippling above and below the relatively flat galactic plane. If so, that would mean a diameter of 
150,000–180,000 light-years (46–55 kpc).</p>

<p>Estimates of the mass of the Milky Way vary, depending upon the method and data used. At the low end of the 
estimate range, the mass of the Milky Way is 5.8×1011 solar masses (M☉), somewhat less than that of the Andromeda 
Galaxy. Measurements using the Very Long Baseline Array in 2009 found velocities as large as 254 km/s 
for stars at the outer edge of the Milky Way. Because the orbital velocity depends on the total mass inside the 
orbital radius, this suggests that the Milky Way is more massive, roughly equaling the mass of Andromeda Galaxy at 
7×1011 M☉ within 160,000 ly (49 kpc) of its center. In 2010, a measurement of the radial velocity of halo stars 
finds that the mass enclosed within 80 kiloparsecs is 7×1011 M☉. According to a study published in 2014, the mass 
of the entire Milky Way is estimated to be 8.5×1011 M☉, which is about half the mass of the Andromeda Galaxy.</p>
