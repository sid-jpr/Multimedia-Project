<h1 align="center"> ---GREATEST ASTRONOMERS OF ALL TIMES--- </h1></font>
<p><font face=cambria size=4>Throughout human history, scientists have struggled to understand what they see in the universe.  
Famous astronomers — many of them  great scientists who mastered many fields — explained the heavens
 with varying degrees of accuracy. Over the centuries, a geocentric view of the universe — with Earth 
at the center of everything — gave way to the proper understanding we have today of an expanding universe 
in which our galaxy is but one of billions. On this list are some of the most famous scientists from the 
early days of astronomy through the modern era, and a summary of some of their achievements.</p></font>
<h3><font face=narkisim> Eratosthenes (276 BCE- 195 BCE) </h3></font>
<img src=28.png align=left width=150>
<p> <font face=cambria size=4>When most people believed the world was flat, the notable Greek mathematician, astronomer and 
geographer Eratosthenes (276 BCE- 195 BCE) used the sun to measure the size of the round Earth. His 
measurement of 24,660 miles (39,690 kilometers) was only 211 miles (340 km) off the true measurement.<br><br><br></font>
<font face=narkisim><h3 align=right> Claudius Ptolemy (AD 90- 168)</h3></font>
<img src=29.gif align=right height=150>
<p><font face=cambria size=4> <br><br>The ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician Claudius Ptolemy (AD 90- 168) set up a model of the solar 
system in which the sun, stars, and other planets revolved around Earth. Known as the Ptolemaic system, 
it remained in place for hundreds of years, though it turned out to be flat wrong.<br><br><br><br></font>
<font face=narkisim><h3> Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi (903-986)</h3></font>
<img src=30.jpg height=150 align=left>
<p> <font face=cambria size=4><br><br>Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi (903-986), known as Azophi to Westerners, made the 
first known observation of a group of stars outside of the Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy.<br><br><br><br></font>
<font face=narkisim><h3 align=right>  Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) </h3></font>
<img src=31.jpg height=150 align=right>
<p> <font face=cambria size=4>In 16th century Poland, astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) proposed a model of the solar 
system that involved the Earth revolving around the sun. The model wasn't completely correct, as 
astronomers of the time struggled with the backwards path Mars sometimes took, but it eventually
 changed the way many scientists viewed the solar system.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></font>
<font face=narkisim><h3>  Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) </h3></font>
<img src=32.jpg height=150 align=left>
<font face=cambria size=4><p> Using detailed measurements of the path of planets kept by Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, 
Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) determined that planets traveled around the sun not in circles but 
in ellipses. In so doing, he calculated three laws involving the motions of planets that astronomers 
still use in calculations today.<br><br><br><br><br><br></font>
<font face=narkisim><h3 align=right> Galileo Galilei (1564-1642)</h3></font>
<img src=33.jpg height=150 align=right>
<font face=cambria size=4><p>Born in Italy, Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) is often credited with the creation of the optical 
telescope, though in truth he improved on existing models. The astronomer (also mathematician, physicist and philosopher) 
turned the new observational tool toward the heavens, where he discovered the four primary moons of Jupiter 
(now known as the Galilean moons), as well as the rings of Saturn. Though a model of the Earth circling the 
sun was first proposed by Copernicus, it took some time before it became widely accepted. Galileo is most 
widely known for defending the idea several years after Kepler had already calculated the path of planets, 
and Galileo wound up under house arrest at the end of his lifetime because of it.<br> <br></font>
<font face=narkisim><h3>  Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) </h3></font>
<img src=34.jpg height=150 align=left>
<font face=cambria size=4><p> Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) proposed the earliest theory about the nature of light, a phenomena 
that puzzled scientists for hundreds of years. His improvements on the telescope allowed him to make the 
first observations of Saturn's rings and to discover its moon, Titan.<br><br><br><br><br><br></font>
<font face=narkisim><h3 align=right> Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) </h3></font>
<img src=35.jpg height=150 align=right>
<font face=cambria size=4><p> Building on the work of those who had gone before him, English astronomer Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) 
is most famous for his work on forces, specifically gravity. He calculated three laws describing the motion 
of forces between objects, known today as Newton's laws.<br><br><br><br><br></font>
<font face=narkisim><h3 align=left> Albert Einstein (1879-1955)</h3></font>
<img src=36.jpg height=150 align=left>
<font face=cambria size=4><p> In the early 20th century, German physicist Albert Einstein (1879-1955) became of of the most famous 
scientists ever after proposing a new way of looking at the universe that went beyond current understanding. 
Einstein suggested that the laws of physics are the same throughout the universe, that the speed of light in a 
vacuum is constant, and that space and time are linked in an entity known as space-time, which is distorted by gravity.<br><br><br><br><br></font>
<font face=narkisim><h3 align=right> Edwin Hubble (1899-1953)</h3></font>
<img src=37.jpg height=150 align=right>
<font face=cambria size=4><p> At the same time Einstein was expanding man's view of the universe, American astronomer Edwin Hubble (1899-1953) 
calculated that a small blob in the sky existed outside of the Milky Way. Prior to his observations, the discussion 
over the size of the universe was divided as to whether or not only a single galaxy existed. Hubble went on to determine 
that the universe itself was expanding, a calculation which later came to be known as Hubble's law. Hubble's observations 
of the various galaxies allowed him to create a standard system of classification still used today.<br><br><br><br></font>
<font face=narkisim><h3 align=left> Stephen Hawking (born 1942) </h3></font>
<img src=38.jpg height=150 align=left>
<font face=cambria size=4><p> Stephen Hawking (born 1942) has made many significant insights into the field of cosmology. 
He proposed that, as the universe has a beginning, it will likely also end. He also suggested that 
it has no boundary or border. Despite being viewed as one of the most brilliant minds since Einstein, 
many of Hawking's books and lectures are steered toward the general public as he seeks to educate people about the universe they live in.<br><br><br><br></font>
<font face=narkisim><h3 align=right> Edmond Halley (1656-1742) </h3></font>
<img src=39.gif height=150 align=right>
<font face=cambria size=4><p> Edmond Halley (1656-1742) was the British scientist who reviewed historical comet sightings and proposed that the 
comet which appeared in 1456, 1531, 1607, and 1682 were all the same, and would return in 1758. Although he died before 
its return, he was proven correct, and the comet was named in his honor.</font>
