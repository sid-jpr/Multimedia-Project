<b><p><font face="Century Gothic" size=4 color=#8CBCE4>Aeronautics (from the ancient Greek words ὰήρ āēr, which means "air", and ναυτική nautikē which means 
"navigation", i.e. "navigation of the air") is the science or art involved with the study, design, and 
manufacturing of airflight-capable machines, and the techniques of operating aircraft and rockets within 
the atmosphere. The British Royal Aeronautical Society identifies the aspects of "aeronautical Art, Science 
and Engineering" and "the profession of Aeronautics (which expression includes Astronautics)."</p>

While the term—literally meaning "sailing the air"—originally referred solely to the science of operating the 
aircraft, it has since been expanded to include technology, business and other aspects related to aircraft.
The term "aviation" is sometimes used interchangeably with aeronautics, although "aeronautics" includes lighter-than-air 
craft such as airships, and includes ballistic vehicles while "aviation" technically does not.</p>

A significant part of aeronautical science is a branch of dynamics called aerodynamics, which deals with the motion of 
air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft.</p></font>
<font face="Century Gothic" size=5 color=#8CBCE4> <h2> Branches </h2></font>
<font face="Century Gothic" size=4 color=#8CBCE4> <p> Aeronautics may be divided into three main branches comprising Aviation, Aeronautical science and Aeronautical engineering.</p>
<br>
<img src=a6.jpg width=475 height=350>
<img src=a9.jpg width=475 height=350>
<p> <b> Aviation </b> </p>
<p> Aviation is the art or practice of aeronautics. Historically aviation meant only heavier-than-air flight, but nowadays it includes flying in balloons and airships.</p>
<p><b> Aeronautical science </b>
<p> Aeronautical science covers the practical theory of aeronautics and aviation, including operations, navigation, air safety and human factors.
A candidate pilot is likely to study for a qualification in aeronautical science.

<p><b>Aeronautical engineering</b>
<p>Aeronautical engineering covers the design and construction of aircraft, including how 
they are powered, how they are used and how they are controlled for safe operation.
A major part of aeronautical engineering is aerodynamics, the science of passage through the air.
With the increasing activity in spaceflight, nowadays aeronautics and astronautics are often 
combined as aerospace engineering.

<p><b>Aerodynamics</b>
<p>The science of aerodynamics deals with the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft.

The study of aerodynamics falls broadly into three areas:
<br><br>
<img src=a18.jpg width=475 height=350>
<img src=a19.jpg width=475 height=350>
<ul>
<li>
Incompressible flow occurs where the air simply moves to avoid objects, typically at subsonic speeds below that of sound (Mach 1).
<li>
Compressible flow occurs where shock waves appear at points where the air becomes compressed, typically at speeds above Mach 1.
<li>
Transonic flow occurs in the intermediate speed range around Mach 1, where the airflow over an object may be locally subsonic at one point and locally supersonic at another.</p>
