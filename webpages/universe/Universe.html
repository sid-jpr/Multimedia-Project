<p>The Universe is all of time and space.This includes planets, stars, galaxies, 
the contents of intergalactic space, the smallest subatomic particles, and all 
matter and energy, the majority of which are most likely in the form of dark 
matter and dark energy.</p>

The part of the Universe that we can see, referred to as the observable 
universe, is about 28 billion parsecs (91 billion light-years) in diameter
at the present time. The size of the whole universe is not known and may be infinite. Scientific 
observation of the Universe has led to inferences about its evolution. These observations suggest 
that the Universe has been governed by the same physical laws and constants throughout most of 
its extent and for all time. The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model that 
describes the development of the Universe. Assuming that the prevailing model is correct, 
the age of the Universe is measured to be 13.798 ± 0.037 billion years. Space in 
the Universe is expanding, and the rate of its expansion is increasing.</p>
<p>
There are many competing theories about the ultimate fate of the Universe. Physicists 
remain unsure about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang. Many refuse to speculate, 
doubting that any information from any such prior state could ever be accessible. There 
are various multiverse hypotheses, in which some physicists have suggested that the 
Universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist. </p>


<h2 class=k> Synonyms & Definitions </h2>
<p>
An alternative interpretation of unvorsum is "everything rotated as one" or "everything rotated by 
one". In this sense, it may be considered a translation of an earlier Greek word for the Universe, 
περιφορά, (periforá, "circumambulation"), originally used to describe a course of a meal, the food 
being carried around the circle of dinner guests. This Greek word refers to celestial spheres, 
an early Greek model of the Universe. Regarding Plato's Metaphor of the Sun, Aristotle suggests that 
the rotation of the sphere of fixed stars inspired by the prime mover, motivates, in turn, terrestrial 
change via the Sun. Careful astronomical and physical measurements (such as the Foucault pendulum) are 
required to prove the Earth rotates on its axis.</p>

A term for 'universe' in ancient Greece was τὸ πᾶν (tò pán, The All, Pan (mythology)). Related terms 
were matter, (τὸ ὅλον, tò hólon, see also Hyle, lit. wood) and place (τὸ κενόν, tò kenón). 
Other synonyms for the Universe among the ancient Greek philosophers included κόσμος (cosmos) and 
φύσις (meaning Nature, from which we derive the word physics). The same synonyms are found in 
Latin authors (totum, mundus, natura) and survive in modern languages, e.g., the German words 
Das All, Weltall, and Natur for Universe. The same synonyms are found in English, such as everything 
(as in the theory of everything), the cosmos (as in cosmology), the world (as in the many-worlds interpretation), 
and Nature (as in natural laws or natural philosophy).</p>

<h2 class=k> Broadest definition: reality and probability</h2>

<p>The broadest definition of the Universe is found in De divisione naturae by the medieval 
philosopher and theologian Johannes Scotus Eriugena, who defined it as simply everything: 
everything that is created and everything that is not created.</p>

<h2 class=k>Definition as reality</h2>

<p> More customarily, the Universe is defined as everything that exists, from its beginning to end.
According to our current understanding, the Universe consists of three principles: spacetime,
 forms of energy, including momentum and matter, and the physical laws that relate them.</p>

<h2 class=k>Definition as connected spacetime</h2>

<img src="universe5.jpg" width=475 align=left><p>It is possible to conceive of disconnected spacetimes, each existing but unable to 
interact with one another. An easily visualized metaphor is a group of separate soap 
bubbles, in which observers living on one soap bubble cannot interact with those on other 
soap bubbles, even in principle. According to one common terminology, each "soap bubble" 
of spacetime is denoted as a universe, whereas our particular spacetime is denoted as the Universe, 
just as we call our moon the Moon. The entire collection of these separate spacetimes is denoted 
as the multiverse. With this terminology, different universes are not causally connected to 
each other. In principle, the other unconnected universes may have different dimensionalities 
and topologies of spacetime, different forms of matter and energy, and different physical laws and 
physical constants, although such possibilities are purely speculative.Others consider each of 
several bubbles created as part of chaotic inflation to be separate universes, though in this model 
these universes all share a causal origin.</p>

<h2 class=k>Definition as observable reality</h2>


<p>According to a still more restrictive definition, the Universe is everything within 
our connected spacetime that could have a chance to interact with us and vice versa.
 According to the general theory of relativity, some regions of space may never interact
with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the finite speed of light and the 
ongoing expansion of space. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach 
some regions of space, even if the Universe would live forever: space may expand faster 
than light can traverse it.
Distant regions of space are taken to exist and be part of reality as much as we are, 
yet we can never interact with them. The spatial region within which we can affect and 
be affected is the observable universe. The observable Universe depends on the location 
of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of 
spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler 
will not be able to interact with all of space. Typically, the observable Universe is taken 
to mean the Universe observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way Galaxy.</p>
